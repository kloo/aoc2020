Powershell implementations to Advent of Code 2020
1. Mostly initial implementations for answers
   * Day 3 part 2 was done with manual inputs and multiplication on the command line for the answer then written in code
   * Sometimes will also add in improved versions in separate script files if I realize anything after submission (ex. Day 5 binary implementation improvements)
1. Script filenames use a and b instead of part 1 and part 2
